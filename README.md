# Betterplate - iOS

Betterplate is a nutritional tracking app for popular restaurants and fast food destinations. A demo video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOXGw07Vfe4).

As a fitness enthusiast and stickler for healthy eating, I wanted to easily access nutritional information of restaurant menu items. However, I could not find an existing solution that integrated nutritional details of a variety of restaurants. I have always had an interest in developing mobile applications, so I decided to build this app myself.

Unfortunately, I had no experience nor knowledge in mobile application development. I decided to self-enroll in a Udemy course for iOS development. This project was not only an excellent introduction into the realm of mobile software, but also allowed me to experiment in web crawling, data processing, and SQLite databases.

The interfaces were built using Interface Builder following the standard MVC pattern. Looking back, I probably would have created views with UIKit programmatically, and used MVVM or a similar architecture to avoid having massive VC's.
